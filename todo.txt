PHASE I: Make the user able to guess and the computer the mastermind
1. Make abstract Player class with basic variables and methods needed to play (a game board, setting guesses, setting a correct answer, updating turn)
2. Make a method to return number of pegs (hints to player of what is correct)
3. Make User class that is able to make guesses and has a constructor
4. Make Computer that can generate a code
5. Make Game.java that runs the game by instantiating a Computer and a User and calling their methods within its own
6. Make User interaction interface

PHASE II: Computer algorithm
1. Make new constructors in User, Computer for when the User is the MasterMind and the Computer is the Guesser
2. Make a way for the User to input a code
3. Code computer algorithm
   a. This will be hard
4. Game.java that runs w/ the computer as the Guesser
5. user interface
