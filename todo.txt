PHASE I: Make the user able to guess and the computer the mastermind
1. Make abstract Player class with basic variables and methods needed to play (a game board, setting guesses, setting a correct answer, updating turn)
2. Make a method to return number of pegs (hints to player of what is correct)
3. Make User class that is able to make guesses and has a constructor
4. Make Computer that can generate a code
5. Make Game.java that runs the game by instantiating a Computer and a User and calling their methods within its own
FINISH 1-5 by Wednesday, 11/11
6. Make User interaction interface and have the game playable with the human User as the guesser
FINISH 6 by 11/11 or 11/12

PHASE II: Computer algorithm
no definitive dates here, we aren't sure how long the Computer algorithm will take
1. Make new constructors in User, Computer for when the User is the MasterMind and the Computer is the Guesser
2. Make a way for the User to input a code
3. Code computer algorithm -- use logic for first two colors then try to generalize for all colors. Has already been outlined on proposal but we need to turn it into code
   a. This will be hard
   b. pseudocode and KTS first
4. Game.java that runs w/ the computer as the Guesser
5. user interface
